In this article, we will show you how to set up and use the HumanTechnik InfraLight LR infrared hearing system. We will also provide some tips and troubleshooting advice to help you get the most out of your device.
 
## Setting Up the Transmitter
 
The transmitter is the base unit that sends the audio signal to the receiver. To set up the transmitter, follow these steps:
 
1. Plug the power adapter into a wall outlet and connect it to the DC IN jack on the back of the transmitter.
2. Connect the audio cable to the AUDIO IN jack on the back of the transmitter. Depending on your audio source, you may need to use an adapter or a different cable. For example, if you want to connect to a TV with a SCART socket, you will need a SCART adapter. If you want to connect to a TV with an optical output, you will need an optical cable and an optical-to-analog converter.
3. Place the transmitter on a flat surface near your audio source. Make sure it is not blocked by any objects or walls that could interfere with the infrared signal.
4. Turn on the power switch on the back of the transmitter. The power indicator on the front should light up green.
5. Adjust the volume knob on the front of the transmitter to set the desired input level. You can also adjust the tone knob to change the bass and treble balance.

## Using the Receiver
 
The receiver is the portable unit that you wear around your neck. It receives the audio signal from the transmitter and sends it to your hearing aid or headphones. To use the receiver, follow these steps:

1. Charge the receiver by placing it on the charging cradle on top of the transmitter. The charging indicator on the front of the receiver should light up red. It takes about 3 hours to fully charge the receiver.
2. Turn on your hearing aid or headphones and connect them to the receiver. You can use either an induction loop or a jack plug. The induction loop is compatible with hearing aids that have a T-coil setting. The jack plug is compatible with headphones that have a 3.5 mm connector.
3. Put on the receiver around your neck and adjust it for comfort. Make sure it is not covered by any clothing or jewelry that could interfere with the infrared signal.
4. Turn on the power switch on the side of the receiver. The power indicator on the front should light up green.
5. Adjust the volume knob on the side of the receiver to set the desired listening level. You can also press the mute button on the front of the receiver to temporarily mute the sound.

## Tips and Troubleshooting
 
Here are some tips and troubleshooting advice to help you get the most out of your HumanTechnik InfraLight LR infrared hearing system:

- The transmitter and receiver have a range of up to 12 meters in direct line of sight. If you move out of range or if there are any obstacles between them, you may experience loss of sound or interference.
- The infrared signal can be affected by sunlight or other infrared sources such as remote controls or heaters. To avoid interference, avoid placing the transmitter or receiver near windows or other infrared sources.
- If you hear a hissing noise or distortion in your hearing aid or headphones, try adjusting the volume or tone knobs on both units until you find a clear sound.
- If you hear no sound at all, check that both units are turned on and charged, that they are within range and line of sight, that they are connected properly to your audio source and hearing aid or headphones, and that your audio source is turned on and playing sound.
