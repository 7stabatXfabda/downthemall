## How to Use Partedit32 to Restore Acer D2D Recovery?
 
Before you proceed, make sure you have backed up your important data and disabled the D2D recovery option in the BIOS. Also, make sure you have a Windows 7 installation disc or USB drive in case something goes wrong.
 
1. Launch Partedit32 and select your hard disk from the drop-down menu.
2. Identify the PQservice partition by its size (it is usually a small partition of about 4 to 9 GB). Note down its index number (the first column).
3. Change the partition type of the PQservice partition to 07 (NTFS) or 0C (FAT32) depending on its file system. To do this, right-click on the partition and select "Change Type". Enter 07 or 0C in the hexadecimal box and click OK.
4. Save the changes by clicking on "Disk" and then "Write Changes". Reboot your laptop.
5. After rebooting, go to Windows Computer Management and mark the PQservice partition as active. To do this, right-click on the partition and select "Mark Partition as Active". Reboot again.
6. Now you should be able to access the PQservice partition from Windows Explorer. Look for two files named mbrwrdos.exe and rtmbr.bin. They may have different names sometimes.
7. Open a command prompt window as an administrator and enter this command: `mbrwrdos.exe install rtmbr.bin`. This will install the Acer MBR on your disk.
8. Close the command prompt window, reboot your laptop, and enable the D2D recovery option in the BIOS.
9. Now you should be able to use ALT+F10 to launch the Acer Erecovery when your laptop starts.

## What is Acer D2D Recovery?
 
Acer D2D recovery is a feature that allows you to restore your Acer laptop to its original factory settings without using any external media. It is also known as Acer Erecovery or Acer eRecovery Management. Acer D2D recovery uses a hidden partition on your hard disk called PQservice that contains a backup image of your system. By pressing ALT+F10 during the boot process, you can access the Acer Erecovery menu and choose to restore your system from the PQservice partition.
 
## Why Restore Acer D2D Recovery?

## What are the Alternatives to Acer D2D Recovery?
 
If you cannot use Acer D2D recovery for some reason, or if you prefer another method, there are some alternatives you can try. Some of them are:

- Using a Windows 7 installation disc or USB drive to reinstall Windows 7 on your laptop. You will need a valid product key for this method.
